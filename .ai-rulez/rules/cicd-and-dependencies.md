# CI/CD and Dependencies

All changes must pass GitHub Actions CI pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yaml) including tests, linting, and security checks. Keep dependencies minimal and up-to-date using Dependabot. Verify compatibility with the latest stable Go version and document any version-specific requirements in go.mod.
